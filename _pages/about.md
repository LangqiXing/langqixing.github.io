⚙️ I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student majoring in Mechanical and 
Industrial Engineering at Northeastern University. 

🧪 My research interests are in Particulate 
clogging, 3-D printing microfluidic approach, capillary flows of complex fluids, and granular 
materials. 
 
🔬 I will be focusing on the microfluidic experiments and I hope to relate these experimental techniques to medical or industrial design.

📖 I was the vice president of the UCSB student chapter of the American Institute of 
Chemical Engineers (AIChE). In my spare time, I enjoy writing songs and rehearse 
in the band. I also loves playing basketball with friends.

👬 I am willing to assisting others on their path in the world of microfluidics and academia.
