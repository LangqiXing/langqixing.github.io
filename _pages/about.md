⚙️ I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student majoring in Mechanical and 
Industrial Engineering at Northeastern University. 

🧪 My research interests are in Particulate 
clogging, 3-D printing microfluidic approach, capillary flows of complex fluids, and granular 
materials. 
 
🔬 I will be focusing on the microfluidic experiments and I hope to relate these experimental techniques to medical or industrial design.

📖 I was the vice president of the UCSB student chapter of the American Institute of 
Chemical Engineers (AIChE). In my spare time, I enjoy writing songs and rehearse 
in the band. I also loves playing basketball with friends.

👬 I am willing to assisting others on their path in the world of microfluidics and academia.

# Selected Experience

## 🌍 Research Assistant
I have experience contributing to [C-Thru Global Project](https://www.c-thru.org/) a 3-year, US $4m, international research project which aims to deliver carbon clarity for the global petrochemical sector.
I helped quantify the energy and emissions footprints of global chemical supply chains and identify
technologies for rapid decarbonization. I also constructed, tested, and refined mass and energy balance models of chemical process systems, and
develop technology databases

## 🥤 R&D Engineer
I have experience working in [PepsiCo](https://www.pepsico.com/#) as a research and development intern.
I really enjoyed the good working atmosphere with a lot of delicious food. 😆 I helped 
Leverage AI techniques such as EXCEL, Python Modules, and Power BI to abstract universal
parameters and requirements for specific ingredients that are commonly used in PepsiCo. 
I also enabled product developers a knowledge-based ingredient specification baseline for a new ingredient
spec for their innovations
