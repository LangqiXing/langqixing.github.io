## ðŸ§¹<i> A Novel No-Scrub Window Cleaner for Skyscrapers
<i> **L. Xing**, Y. Xi, G. Wang, D. Lai </i>

- Designed a novel non-scrub window cleaner for skyscrapers
- Used soft matter concepts to clean dust with diameters ranging from 1 to 100 Âµm
- Used water as a solvent, with various surfactants, acidic components, hydrophobic coating agents, and foam stabilizers
- Specified the ingredients, yield strength, and viscosity ranges in the cleaner
