#### <i> Production of Benzene by Hydrodealkylation of Toluene
**L. Xing**, Selina Liu, Yunus Ross </i>

- Designed a conceptual process and techno economic analysis for the conversion of
propane and bromine to produce 100 kta of propylene in Alkyl Products Limited Company.
- Used 3 PFRs, 1 electrochemical reactor, and 6 distillation columns.
- Calculated project NPV = $18 MM, NPV% = 0.69%, IRR = 12%. after 13 years of operation

#### <i> A Novel No-Scrub Window Cleaner for Skyscrapers
**L. Xing**, Y. Xi, G. Wang, D. Lai </i>

- Designed a novel non-scrub window cleaner for skyscrapers
- Used soft matter concepts to clean dust with diameters ranging from 1 to 100 Âµm
- Used water as a solvent, with various surfactants, acidic components, hydrophobic coating agents, and foam stabilizers.
- Specified the ingredients, yield strength, and viscosity ranges in the cleaner
